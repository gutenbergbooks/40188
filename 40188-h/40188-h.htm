<blockquote>
<p><span class="spaced i2">SIR,</span></p>

<p>The author of the following Eclogue, having requested my assistance
to introduce it to the world; it was with more indignation than
surprize I was informed of your having used your extensive influence
over the press to prevent its being advertised in the News-papers.
How are you, Sir, concerned in the Lamentation of <i>Roscius</i> for his
<i>Nyky</i>? Does your modesty think no man entitled to the appellation
of Roscius but yourself? Does Nyky resemble any nick-named favourite
of yours? Or does it follow, that if you have cherished an unworthy
favourite, you must bear too near a resemblance to him? <i>Qui
capit ille facit</i>; beware of self-accusation, where others bring no
charge! Or, granting you right in these particulars, by what right or
privilege do you, Sir, set up for a licenser of the press? That you
have long successfully usurped that privilege, to swell both your fame
and fortune, is well known. Not the puffs of the quacks of Bayswater
and Chelsea are so numerous and notorious: but by what authority
do you take upon you to shut up the general channel, in
which writers usher their performances to the public? If they attack
either your talents or your character, <i>in utrumque paratus</i>, you
are armed to defend yourself. You have, besides your ingenuous
countenance and conscious innocence; <i>Nil conscire sibi, nulla pallescere
culpa</i>; Besides this brazen bulwark, I say, you have a ready
pen and a long purse. The press is open to the one, and the bar
is ever ready to open with the other. For a poor author, not a
printer will publish a paragraph, not a pleader will utter a quibble.
You have then every advantage in the contest: It is needless,
therefore, to endeavour to intimidate your antagonists by
countenancing your retainers to threaten their lives! These intimidations,
let me tell you Sir, have an ugly, suspicious look.
They are besides needless; the <i>genus irritabile vatum</i> want no such
personal provocations; Heaven knows, the life of a play-wright, like
that of a spider, is in a state of the most slender dependency. It
is well for my rhiming friend that his hangs not on so slight a
thread. He thinks, nevertheless, that he has reason to complain,
as well as the publick, of your having long preferred the flimzy,
translated, patch'd-up and mis-altered pieces of your favourite compilers,
to the arduous attempts at originality of writers, who have
no personal interest with the manager. In particular, he thinks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_III" id="Page_III">III</a></span>
the two pieces, you are projecting to get up next winter, for the
emolument of your favorite in disgrace, or to reimburse yourself
the money, you may have advanced him, might, for the present
at least, be laid aside.</p>

<p>But you will ask me, perhaps, in turn, Sir, what right I have
to interfere with the business of other people, or with yours? I
will answer you. It is because I think your business, as patentee
of a theatre-royal, is not so entirely yours, but that the publick
also have some concern in it. You, Sir, indeed have long behaved
as if you thought the town itself a purchased appurtenance
to the theatre; but, tho' the scenes and machines are yours; nay,
tho' you have even found means to make comedians and poets
your property; it should be with more caution than you practise,
that you extend your various arts to make so scandalous a property
of the publick.</p>

<p>Again I answer, it is because I have some regard for my friend,
and as much for myself, whom you have treated as ill perhaps as
you have done any other writer; while under your auspices, some of
the persons stigmatised by the satirist, have frequently combined
to do me the most essential injury. But <i>nemo me impune lacessit</i>.
Not that I mean now to enter into particulars which may be
thought to relate too much to myself and too little to the publick.
When I shall have leisure to draw a faithful portraiture of Mr.
Garrick, not only from his behaviour to me in particular, but
from his conduct towards poets, players and the town in general,
I doubt not to convince the most partial of his admirers that he hath
accumulated a fortune, as manager, by the meanest and most meretricious
devices, and that the theatrical props, which have long
supported his exalted reputation, as an actor, have been raised on
the ruins of the English stage.</p>

<p>In the mean time, I leave you to amuse yourself with the following
jeu d'esprit of my friend; hoping, tho' it be a severe correction
for the errours of your past favouritism, it may prove a salutary
guide to you for the future. With regard to its publication I hope
also to stand excused with the reader for thus interposing to defeat
the success of those arts, which you so unfairly practise to prevent,
from reaching the public eye, whatever is disagreeable to your own.</p>

<p class="right">I am, Sir,<br />
Yours, &amp;c.<br />

rejected, as unfit for the theatre, on account of having so many of Shakespeare's

on a pageant, in which were almost all Shakespeare's known characters; when
finding it difficult to make any of them speak with propriety, he contented
himself with instructing them to bite their thumbs, screw up their mouths,
and make faces at each other, to the great edification of the audience.&mdash;This
play indeed was afterwards performed, and tho' received with the most

almost empty houses: and yet <span class="smcap">Roscius</span> hath all the while pretended to

of the present age, it was immoral and indecent: that on a close examination,
he found in it excessive obscenity; that the character of Manly

<p>Certain circumstances, to which the author of the foregoing
piece was an utter stranger, having happened about the time of its
publication, and given rise to rumours equally false and foreign to
the party; it appears that Roscius, or some of his friends, was pleased
to insert the following queries in the Morning Chronicle of July 2d.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Candour presents her compliments to Mr.&mdash;&mdash;, she begs his
pardon,&mdash;&mdash; to Dr.&mdash;&mdash; <i>Kenrick</i>, and desires to ask him a few simple
questions; to which, if he be the <i>Plain-dealer</i> he pretends, he will
give a plain and direct answer.</p>

<p><i>Query</i> I. Whether you are not the author of the eclogue, entitled,
<i>Love in the Suds</i>, as well as of the letter prefixed to it?</p>

<p>II. Whether you did not mean, though you have artfully evaded
the law, by affecting the translation of a classical cento, to throw out
the most scandalous insinuations against the character of Roscius?</p>

<p>III. Whether you were not likewise the author of an infamous,
anonymous paragraph in a public paper; for which that paper is under
a just prosecution?</p>

<p>IV. Whether you have not openly acknowledged notwithstanding,
that you really entertained a very different opinion of Roscius?</p>

<p>V. Whether any cause of dispute, that might subsist between you
and Roscius, can authorize so cruel, so unmanly an attack?</p>

<p>VI. Whether the brother of Roscius did not personally wait on
you to require, in his name, the satisfaction of a gentleman, which
you refused him?</p>

<p class="right">CANDOUR."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
</p></blockquote>

<p>To these queries, the author judged it expedient to make the following
reply in the same paper of July 4th.</p>


<p>To <span class="spaced">CANDOUR.</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Madam</span>,</p>

<p>"Though I think your signature a misnomer, to shew that I a
no stranger to the name and quality you assume, I shall not stand on
the punctilio of your being an <i>anonymous</i> querist; but answer your
several questions explicitly.</p>

<p>I. I am the author of the eclogue you mention.</p>

<p>II. I did not mean to throw out the <i>most</i> scandalous insinuations
on the character of Roscius, nor any insinuation <i>more</i> scandalous than
his conduct. How far that has been so, he knows best, and is left to
make the application.</p>

<p>III. An <i>infamous</i> paragraph I <i>cannot</i> write; and an <i>anonymous</i> one
I <i>will not</i> write, to prejudice my greatest enemy. As to that in question,
I have not, to this hour, even seen it. <span class="smcap">Calumny</span> I <i>detest</i>; but
I think <i>vice</i> should be exposed to <i>infamy</i>, nor have I so much <i>false
delicacy</i> as to conceive, it should be treated with <i>tenderness</i> in proportion
as it is <i>abominable</i>.</p>

<p>IV. I have not acknowledged that I entertain a <i>very different</i>
opinion of Roscius; on the contrary, I declare, that I entertain a <i>very
indifferent</i> opinion of him.</p>

<p>V. As to the cause of our dispute, I should be very ready to submit
it to the publick, were I egotist enough to think it deserved their attention.</p>

<p>VI. The brother of Roscius <i>did personally wait</i> on me, to desire I
would meet "him, the said Roscius, who would bring a friend
with him; I being at liberty to do the same;" but as nothing of time,
place, or weapon was mentioned, I did not look on this message as a
challenge; nor well could I, as I never heard of requiring <i>gentleman's
satisfaction</i> by <i>letter of attorney</i>, and the professed end of our meeting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
turned merely on a matter of business.&mdash;It is possible, indeed, the
messenger, otherwise instructed, might <i>imagine</i> it such, especially as,
it seems, his head has teemed with nothing but challenges and duels,
since his magnanimous monomachy with one of his brother Roscius's
candle-snuffers.&mdash;That Roscius himself, however, did not mean to
send me a challenge, is plain, from his solliciting afterwards by letter, a
conference in the presence only of a common friend to both: a request
that would have been complied with, had not he thought proper, in
a most ungentleman-like manner, to make a confidant, in the meantime,
of a booby of a bookseller, who had the folly and impudence
to declare that he would, on <i>his</i> [Roscius's] account, <i>take an opportunity</i>
to do <i>me</i> some desperate mischief.&mdash;Lest I should be yet supposed,
from the purport of this last query, to have any fear of a personal
encounter with the doughty Roscius, I require only that it may be
on an equal footing. I am neither so extravagantly fond of life, nor
think myself so consequential in it, as to fear the end of it from such
an antagonist; nor, to say the truth, should I have any qualms of
conscience, if nothing less will satisfy him, about putting an end to
so insignificant a being as his: but, as "the race is not to the
swift, nor the battle to the strong," it is but right to provide against
a mishap. Roscius has a large fortune, and little or no family to
leave it to: I have a large family, and little or no fortune to leave it.
Let Roscius but previously settle <i>only half</i> his estate on my heirs, on
condition that <i>he</i> deprives them of a protector, and I will meet him
to-morrow, and engage at his own weapons, not only him, but his
brother George into the bargain.<a name="FNanchor36" id="FNanchor36" href="#Footnote36" class="label">36</a></p>

<p>And now, Madam <span class="smcap">Candour</span>, give me leave to ask <i>you</i> a question
or two, in my turn.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span></p>

<p><i>Qu.</i> I. Whether, from many gross instances of misbehaviour, <i>Roscius</i>
hath not long had sufficient reason to suspect the detestable character
of <i>Nyky</i>?</p>

<p>II. Whether, therefore, granting Roscius to be himself <i>immaculate</i>,
he is excusable for his notorious partialities to such a character?</p>

<p>III. Whether he has any right to complain of unjust severity, in
being ludicrously reproached with such partialities, by a writer,
whom he hath treated, even in favour of that very wretch, with disrespect,
with insolence, with injustice.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="spaced">W. KENRICK</span>."</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="footnote"><a name="Footnote36" id="Footnote36" href="#FNanchor36"><span class="label">36</span></a> The above pleasantry being misconstrued by some of Roscius's friends to the
disadvantage of the author, the latter thought himself under the necessity of seriously
acquainting the former, of his being ready, as he is, at any time, to give him such satisfaction
as a gentleman, who supposes himself injured, has a right to require.</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Instead of <i>candidly</i> replying, however, to the above three queries,
a very difficult task, indeed, to Roscius, he caused the Court of King's
Bench to be moved for a rule to shew cause, why leave should not be
given him to file an information against the author for a libel: which
being granted of course, the same was exultingly announced in the following
paragraphs inserted in all the news-papers:</p>

<p>"Yesterday morning Mr. Dunning made a motion in the Court
of King's Bench, for a rule to shew cause why an information should
not be laid against the author of Love in the Suds. When the court
was pleased to grant a rule for the first day of next term. The poem
was read in court by the Clerk of the Crown, and afforded no small
diversion when it came to that part which reflects upon a certain
Chief Justice, who was present all the time.</p>

<p>"Besides Mr. Wallace and Mr. Dunning, who are employed by
great actor, in his prosecution of some detestable charges which have
been lately urged with <i>as much folly as wickedness</i> against his character,
Mr. Murphy and Mr. Mansfield are also engaged, and the cause
now becomes a matter of much expectation with the publick."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To these paragraphs the author judged it necessary to make the
following reply, in the above-mentioned Morning Chronicle; almost
all the rest of the news-papers, by the indefatigable industry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
and powerful influence of Roscius, a proprietor in most of them,
being shut against him.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="spaced">SIR</span>,</p>

<p>"In reprehending others you should ever be cautious of falling
into the error you condemn. In yesterday's paper you indirectly
charge me, among others, with having "urged a detestable charge
with as much folly as wickedness against a certain great actor."&mdash;What
other people have done I know not, nor does it concern me;
but I may safely defy all the Lawyers in Westminster-Hall fairly to
deduce such a charge as you hint at from the eclogue in question.
In this respect it is certainly as innocent as the great actor's Jubilee
Ode! But granting it otherwise with any one else, how can you take
upon you to say that such a charge is urged <i>foolishly and wickedly</i>?
Can <i>you</i> know it to be false or groundless? And if not, on what
grounds do you charge the accusers with <i>folly</i> and <i>wickedness?</i> Why
does not the <span class="smcap">Candour</span> of the great actor, reply to the Queries put
to him in your paper of Saturday last? But no; unable to justify
himself at the bar of the publick, he flies for refuge to the quirks and
quibbles of Westminster-Hall; and even this at the latter end of a
term, in order to deceive the town into a notion that the court will
countenance his prosecution. Why was not his motion made
sooner, that cause might have been shewn in time, and the futility of
it made immediately evident? Believe me, Sir, before an end is put
to this business, the publick will be better enabled to judge on which
side the <i>folly</i> and <i>wickedness</i> lies, than you appear to do at present.</p>
